# 📊 Automating Sales Reporting with n8n, GitHub & AI

This project demonstrates how **low-code automation + AI** can transform raw sales data into **daily executive-ready insights** — fully automated from source to delivery.

I built a modular workflow in **n8n** that pulls sales data from a GitHub repository, processes it with lightweight JavaScript, summarizes with AI, and delivers reports automatically by email.

---

## 🚀 Workflow Overview

1. **⏰ Trigger** — Runs on a fixed schedule (no manual starts needed).  
2. **📥 Data Source** — Pulls the latest Excel/CSV directly from this GitHub repo (acts as the single source of truth).  
3. **📊 Processing** — Parses and cleans data, computes:
   - Total revenue  
   - Average order value  
   - Top products  
   - Category-wise revenue  
   - City-wise revenue  
4. **🤖 AI Summary** — Uses a controlled LLM prompt to generate a **2–3 sentence sales summary**.  
5. **📤 Output** — Summary stored via JS `return function` and instantly delivered by email.
